         <b>bonjour. I am Ayena. (ayena32)</b> I like tech, history, geography, cricket, politics, finance, media, and food. That
         is a lot of things but I still like them all. I daily drive a Samsung Galaxy S8+ as my main/only phone and it's not
         actually that bad. I also use an Asus ROG Ally. Recently I started getting into aviation as well. I am a Muslim living
         in a foreign, non-Muslim country and it's actually quite nice to live there, I even got a passport in that country.
         Mostly self taught in coding and I have a passion for Windows and Android. Currently I speak English, Bangla (both fluent),
         French and Spanish.<br/>
        <b>About Biryani Tech: </b> We don't actually manufacture technology yet. Biryani Tech is currently a 
        nonprofit publishing tech news, reviews, articles, and recipes.<br/>
        <b>The culinary world is full of heavy hitters. You’ve got pizza holding it down for comfort, sushi bringing that refined aesthetic,
            and burgers serving reliability. But when you cut through the noise and look for the undisputed champion—the dish that brings main character energy
            to every table, there is only one answer. It’s Biryani. To say Biryani is just "rice and meat" is like saying the Mona Lisa is just "paint and canvas."
            It’s a violation. Biryani isn’t just a meal; it’s an emotion, a vibe, and objectively the best dish on the planet. First off, let’s talk about the flavor
            profile. It absolutely slaps. Most dishes rely on a sauce or a side to do the heavy lifting, but Biryani is a standalone flex. The complexity of the spices
            —cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, star anise; creates a symphony that hits different with every bite. The magic lies in the "Dum" style of cooking, 
            a low-and-slow method where the pot is sealed with dough to trap the steam. This forces the aroma of the spices to penetrate the meat and rice so deeply 
            that they become one. When you crack open that seal, the scent alone is enough to live rent-free in your head for days.
            Then there is the texture game, which is elite. You have the fluffy, long-grain basmati rice that stands tall and separate (if your rice is clumping, that’s a red flag, fam). 
            Contrasting that is the meat—be it chicken, mutton, or goat—which has been marinated to perfection until it literally falls off the bone. And let’s not forget the unsung heroes:
            the crispy fried onions (barista) that add that necessary crunch and sweetness, and the occasional saffron-soaked potato in the Bengali variant that low-key steals the show.
            The layering of these elements creates a texture that is anything but mid.
            Furthermore, Biryani is the ultimate shape-shifter. The range is wild. You want heat and intensity? The Hyderabadi Kachchi Biryani wakes you up. You want something subtle and aromatic?
            The Lucknowi (Awadhi) style is pure elegance. You a seafood fan? The Malabar Fish Biryani has got you covered. Even the debate between Bengal (team potato) and Hyderabad (team spice)
            brings people together in passionate defense of their favorites. It’s a dish that adapts to local cultures while keeping its soul intact. It’s got global appeal but stays true to its roots.
            Beyond the actual taste, Biryani brings people together. It’s the centerpiece of every South Asian wedding, the comfort food for every heartbreak, and the reward for every small win.
            It’s communal. You don’t eat Biryani alone in a corner; you share a massive handi with the squad. There is a specific kind of camaraderie that happens when everyone is digging into the same platter,
            hunting for the best pieces of meat. And let’s be real, the "Biryani nap" that hits you afterwards? That food coma is the best sleep you will ever get. It shuts your system down in the best way possible.
            In conclusion, other dishes might have their moment in the spotlight, but Biryani is the forever king. It checks every box: flavor complexity, technical difficulty, regional variety, and emotional impact.
            It doesn’t just feed you; it blesses you. In a world full of culinary trends that come and go, Biryani has stayed consistent, iconic, and absolutely fire. If you think otherwise, you’re just wrong.</b> <br/>
